AUTO (Automate YoUr Terminal Operation) is a powerful command-line tool designed to streamline your workflow by automating the execution of commands in separate instances of the terminal. With AUTO, you can easily define scripts containing sequences of commands, and the tool will run each command in its own terminal instance.
How to use:

Create a file .autofile then add commands like below in the .autofile:
```cmd
# This is a comment
# Define the dev block
dev {
  # Run taskkill single use command
  $ taskkill /im node.exe
  
  # Run MongoDB server in the background
  - mongod.exe --dbpath C:\data\db

  # Run the web server normally
  + node server.js

  # Run the file server
  + python fileserver.py

  # Execute many commands in the same line
  + set PORT=4000 && npm start --prefix client

  # Run attendance frontend server
  + npm start --prefix attendance

  # Run hris backend server
  + npm run --prefix server dev
}

```

then run in terminal:
```
auto
```

## NOTE:
Once the commands inside the .autofile is already RUNNING no need to rerun again the auto command sometimes it can cause error to the commands execution
specially if the a specify command can only run in ONE INSTANCE.
